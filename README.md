### What is this?
This repository contains the code and a report accompanying a master's thesis "Describing Images Using Natural Language".
The code is an extension of [NeuralTalk](https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk). It contains several RNN-based language models.
The full thesis (written in Dutch) can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uodqsnu3gnk16fc/masterproef.pdf?dl=0).
The short accompanying paper is placed [here](https://github.com/spijs/AutomaticImageDescription_Thesis/blob/master/Report/Paper/killerpaper.pdf).

The *Code* folder contains all code, while the *Report* folder hosts all LaTeX source files and images to generate the report.
