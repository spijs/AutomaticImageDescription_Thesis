\paragraph{Karpathy's code}
Karpathy hosts two implementations on his GitHub page. The first one is an implementation of his own RNN and the second one is an implementation based on the paper on LSTM by Vinyals. We cloned both implementations and trained them on the Flickr30k dataset. The results of this training process will be used as a baseline for our experiments.
